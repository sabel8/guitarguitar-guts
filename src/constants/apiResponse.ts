      "<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that big bar of gold next to the soundhole. Yes, Gretsch have whapped a big ol’ Fideli’Tron electric guitar pickup onto the face of this Rancher acoustic! We were very intrigued to say the least when this guitar was first delivered!</p>\r\n<p>So, before we get ahead of ourselves, let us check out what we have here. The G5031FT is a Dreadnought with a solid Spruce top and a host of nice Gretsch details like thumbnail inlays, gold hardware, a ton of binding and a most distinctive triangular soundhole! The Sunburst finish is gorgeous too, a great contrast with the Gold hardware.</p>\r\n<p>The fit and finish is excellent: quality control is obviously high and this guitar plays very agreeably. Sonically, the Spruce top and laminated Mahogany work with the dreadnought shape and scalloped X-bracing to create a strong tone with a bright top and a good note fundamentals. Strumming is excellent and fingerpicking sounds extremely pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>So what of this pickup? Well, this Fideli’Tron pickup has been seen on electric guitars like the Fender Cabronita already but it was in fact developed for this range of Gretsch acoustics. It has a clear, low output and is nestled in a wooden box (‘isolation chamber’) to sort out feedback problems. And yes, it does sound like a mix between an electric and an acoustic! Its definitely not supposed to give you sumptuous life-like acoustic tones: it’s meant to give a large, slightly darker voice that suits supportive rhythmic playing and effects-laden soundscaping over straight up lead soloing. It works well and if you want a more lo-fi, scuzzy sound then this will reveal itself to be very useful (and fun) for you!</p>\r\n<p>It’s a unique guitar and no mistake: only Gretsch could do something like this! It is a success though for sure, as long as you what to expect! We love it. More of this!</p>",

      "<p>The GN20CE uses Takamine's most famous body design - the NEX - to create an affordable guitar that is big on sound and low on price. This body size is a little bit smaller than a standard jumbo size but retains much of the big sound that jumbos are noted for. This is ideal because the guitar itself is a good deal more comfortable to get to grips with and is very 'lap-friendly'! </p>\r\n<p>Sonically, the body size works with the solid Cedar top and laminated Mahogany to produce a warm, balanced sound with a strong upper mid response that records exceptionally well and suits strumming techniques in particular. There is a cutaway on the lower bout to facilitate upper fret access. The Natural finish has some nicely contrasting black and white binding around it to finish things neatly.</p>\r\n<p>Takamine's own design TP-4T Preamp and pickup system is fitted to ensure live performances sound professional and inspiring. This guitar is a handsome and affordable choice for players looking for a good songwriting machine with a warm tone that will just keep on improving the more you play it.</p>",
    productDetail:
      "<p>The GN20CE-NS combines Takamine's compact but big-sounding NEX body style with solid-top construction and a proprietary electronics system to create a guitar that looks as good as it sounds.</p>\r\n<p>For players looking for a different sound, the GN20CE-NS pairs a solid cedar top with mahogany back and sides to produce a warm, detailed tone that works beautifully for a wide range of musical styles. The slim satin-finish mahogany neck and 12\"-radius rosewood fingerboard provide great feel and playability, while the onboard Takamine TP-4TD preamp system gives you a built-in tuner with three-band EQ and gain controls for excellent amplified performance and versatility.</p>\r\n<p>Other great features include a synthetic bone nut and split bridge saddle, rosewood headcap, pearloid dot inlays, chrome die-cast tuners, and an elegant Natural satin finish.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Yamaha’s FG line has been in constant production since the mid 60s and is now something of a minor classic. Yamaha’s take on the dreadnought, the FG (presumably for Folk Guitar) is a great amalgamation of good design, excellent production standards and fantastic value for money.</p>\r\n<p>The FGX830C builds on the success of the FGX electro acoustic range by adding rosewood for the back & sides, creating a sound that has more harmonic content and a little less mid range. Strumming sounds more effective than ever as a result! A new scalloped bracing design increases sound and projection too. The System 66 piezo pickup system is in place to have you ready for the stage: the control panel includes a 3 band EQ and a tuner for on stage convenience. </p>\r\n<p>As well as the rosewood, the FGX830C enjoys some cosmetic upgrades that really enhance the guitar’s appearance: this has binding on the headstock, fingerboard and body (multi-ply binding on the body) and the soundhole rosette now has inlaid abalone, a beautiful touch! The FGX830C, available in Natural, is an excellent choice for the guitarist looking for an affordable all-rounder that looks and sounds great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>9 Volt battery not included.</strong></p>\r\n",

There are quite a lot of distinguishing features on hand here, all designed to make this guitar extremely useful for the pro player.<br/><br/>\r\nChief amongst these is the active mid boost, controlled with the second tone knob. This boost almost turns your mild-mannered Strat into a beastly high output rock monster! Otherwise the pickups on here are vintage voiced noiseless units, a replacement from the previously used Lace Sensors.<br/><br/>\r\nInterestingly, the tremolo unit, whilst being fully functional in theory, has been blocked off underneath with a piece of wood at Clapton's request. It's an simple matter of pulling the block out if this spoils your whammy bar fun though! <br/><br/>\r\nThe neck is also a departure compared to most Stratocaster models: this has a typical 9.5\" radius across the front but a relatively unique \"shallow V\" carve at the back. It seems a bold choice until you play it and find out it's really comfortable and promotes lots of playing without fatigue. Overall it's a tremendous instrument, again not just for Clapton fans. However, if you do worship at the temple of Eric, this is a no-brainer and of course if you choose this finish, you'll be buying you own version of \"Blackie\".",

Cobain designed his own custom guitar, the Jagstang, not long before he died and that posthumously became his first signature guitar in the mid 1990s. This Jaguar, however, is famed precisely because it was one of his most visible on stage instruments. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis left-handed, heavily modified Jaguar is based on Cobain's 1965 model. The pickups have been changed to a pair of DiMarzio humbuckers, namely a Super Distortion in the bridge and a PAF in the neck. This of course completely changes the sound: the spiky, nasal twang of the Jag is replaced with thick, powerful humbucker rock sounds; it's a very chunky sound!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe rosewood neck is bound and the headstock is small like a Stratocaster. Even the infamous Jaguar tone controls have been simplified to a three way toggle and a brace of volume and tone knobs.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis fantastic package is completed by a the inclusion of a hard case and a photo book of rare Cobain portraits.",

      "<p>New from Yamaha for 2018 is the CPX600. The latest model in a long successful line, think of this  as the larger brother of the new APX600 and you will be close to the mark for what we have here. Like the APX, this CPX600I is designed expressly for taking out of the house and onto a stage! With what we’d call a Medium Jumbo body, the CPX gives a larger, more percussive and bass heavy sound. This is ideal for singers who play solo gigs: the extra sonic space filled by the CPX is perfect as an accompaniment for vocals.</p>\r\n<p>The large CPX body has a slightly narrow waist which takes away a little of the mids to give this a great strumming sound: there’s plenty of top and bottom to work in concert to produce that big sound. The bracing inside the body has a new design to create more overall focus. The body also has a Venetian cutaway to provide dextrous players an easier opportunity to scale the dusty end of the fretboard!</p>\r\n<p>Like the new APX600, the CPX600 has a revised 25” scale length to make playing easier and more comfortable than ever: the neck width has also been reduced a touch to make difficult chord shapes easier to stretch to.</p>\r\n<p>A newly re-developed pickup system provides the player with an excellent live sound that’s reliable and very low on feedback.</p>\r\n<p>If you are looking for an instrument that sounds large and confident onstage and off, this Yamaha CPX600 (in Root Beer) is an excellent choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>9 Volt battery not included.</strong></p>\r\n",

      "<p>Combining the performance of the APX 600 with a bigger body for traditional looks and a more powerful, louder acoustic sound, the CPX 600 offers all of the advantages of the APX models with all of the style of the Yamaha's jumbo body style</p>",

A small Mother of Pearl ‘F’ inlay at the 12th fret is this guitar’s only concession to extravagance.</p>\r\n<p>The Venus is an original body design and perhaps the most recognisable shape in Faith’s catalogue. It’s relatively similar to an Orchestral sized guitar and offers a similar combination of sound, projection and percussion, making this a great all-rounder.

A Shadow pickup system allows you to take this straight onto your local stage when it’s time to get gigging!</p>\r\n<p>This guitar is perfect for the gigging player who both strums and fingerpicks, who wants a solid-timbered guitar and relished the notion of having it pick up a few scars along the way to give the guitar even more character.</p>',

      "<h2>At A Glance</h2>\r\n<p>The Taylor Swift Baby Taylor TSBT-e is a small body acoustic designed to give anyone a big voice. Unless you've been living under a rock, chances are that you are aware of the impact Taylor Swift has made with her unique style of music. She continues to inspire musicians across a number of styles and this beautiful guitar from Taylor is another aspect of that influence. Back in her youth before she was the household name she is now, Swift was writing songs on her own Baby Taylor guitar. This model, which is based on the 3/4 scale Dreadnought, captures the essence of that magical time in her life. A layered sapele body and a solid \r\nsitka spruce top provide a solid construction and allow this guitar to sing beautifully. A pickup and preamp make this perfect for those who perform live. As you would expect from Taylor Guitars, this is a well made instrument and \r\nwould be ideal for players at any level. </p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screen Printed Design</h3>\r\n<p>This design is <strong>filled with Swift's unique charm and style</strong>. The intricate \r\ndetail around the soundhole features a rosette design with the word 'Love' \r\nweaved into the vine pattern. Her signature takes centre place above the bridge \r\nand adds an extra touch of Tay Tay influence to this beautiful guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Expression System Baby Pickup</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring Taylor's impressive Expression System Baby pickup, it is perfect \r\nfor those who are looking to perform live or record. Being able to plug in and \r\nplay is a great feature and is also <strong>very practical with the onboard preamp and \r\ntuner</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Compact Size Body</h3>\r\n<p>The smaller body size is perfect for those who prefer a more compact size. \r\nWhether you want a guitar that is easier to carry to practice and gigs or \r\nsomething that comfortably fits under your arm, this is <strong>a great size for both \r\nbeginners and pros alike</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>\r\n<p>Of course this guitar is perfect for any Taylor Swift fan. Additionally it's a great choice for any new or young player thanks to it's comfortable size and easy playability. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Perfect for those who prefer a more compact acoustic</li>\r\n\t<li>An ideal guitar for any fan of Taylor Swift</li>\r\n\t<li>Versatile due to the pickup and preamp</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "<p>Inspired by memories of writing songs on her own Baby Taylor, Taylor Swift collaborated with Taylor Guitars to design the Taylor Swift Baby Taylor (TSBT). Based on our compact ¾-scale Dreadnought, the TSBT is crafted from a resilient layered sapele body with a solid Sitka spruce top. Swift’s screen-printed rosette design features the word “Love” three times among a delicate vine motif. The personalized design also features her stylized signature above the bridge. With a slim 1 11/16-inch neck and a compact shape, the guitar is perfect for a young, aspiring tunesmith. This edition also features the Expression System Baby™ (ES-B) pickup for a smooth plug-and-play experience. Adding to the utility is a built-in digital chromatic tuner on the preamp. The preamp/tuner unit features an LED display for tuning and low battery indication, along with Tone and Volume controls.\r\n\r\n</p>",

Body shapes, bracings and \r\nconstructions were carefully considered before opening molds for our body shapes \r\nand finalizing specifications.</p>\r\n<p>Alvarez Blues guitars have a vintage vibe all the way, with a small rectangle \r\nbridge, V profile neck, 2 ¼” string spacing and back shifted bracing to make \r\nthese smaller bodied guitars feel and sound just right.</p>\r\n<p>Tonally they deliver the compressed bluesy bark expected from such a design, \r\nbut the refined back-shifted, scalloped bracing adds more openness for a \r\nslightly more modern style projection.</p>\r\n<p>The Delta 00 has a 14th fret neck join to the body, grained ivoroid binding \r\nand a perfect vintage burst. It’s a responsive guitar and although suited more \r\ntowards fingerstyle it takes open chord strumming in its stride. This \r\nacoustic-electric model features the fantastic LR Baggs Element pickup, VTC \r\nsystem to optimize live performance.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Yamaha's proprietary under-saddle piezo pickup and System 66 \r\nanalog preamp ensure you'll always have a solid plugged-in performance. The \r\nsmall and thin body is perfect not only for female/young players, but for \r\nintermediate-to-upper level finger-picking style players as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Special \r\nBracing</strong><br>Yamaha's FS guitars have a louder and stronger sound in the \r\nlow-to-mid ranges, thanks to cutting-edge acoustic analysis technology developed \r\nby the Yamaha R&D Division. Yamaha’s engineers have achieved this sound by \r\nutilizing analysis and simulation to arrive at the best bracing design without \r\ndepending on tradition or guesswork. This analysis led to the development of the \r\nnew scalloped bracing pattern, a new and ideal acoustic structure that maintains \r\nthe durability of the top board while bringing out the most sound the Yamaha FS \r\nhas to offer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thinner body</strong><br>The FS model body is 10mm slimmer than that \r\nof the FG body, offering increased comfort and playability with no loss of \r\nvolume or bass. Having a body that is easier to hold makes the FS more appealing \r\nto beginners and smaller guitarists, including female players. In addition, the \r\nsmaller dimensions and lower propensity to feedback make FS guitars ideal for \r\nstage use.</p>\r\n<p><strong>System 66 Electronics</strong><br>System 66 feature an under-saddle \r\npiezo pickup developed by Yamaha. Controls include a 3-band EQ, an adjustable \r\nmid-range frequency control, and a precision chromatic tuner for optimum sound \r\ntailoring. The system is powered by easy to obtain AA-size batteries that \r\nprovide a stable power supply for improved sound quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong>9 Volt battery not included.</strong></p>\r\n",

Bringing to the table an \r\nalternative to the '50s Les Paul Standard, this '60s version comes with a \r\nslimmer neck profile and swaps the pickups for a sound subtly different to that \r\nof the '50s Standard.</p>\r\n<p>The body of this model has zero weight relief, a bonus for Les Paul \r\naficionados, some who believe the drill holes used by Gibson to remove the heft \r\nof a solid mahogany body, take with them some of the tone.  Gibson have \r\nlistened to those who are after a 'full fat' Les Paul, and have delivered \r\nexactly that.</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>Full Fat Les Paul</h3>\r\n<p>A point of contention, some believe that the chambered body of newer Les \r\nPauls can have a thinner tone than what you would expect to get from a Les Paul. \r\nThis model has none of that! This mahogany body has zero weight relief giving \r\nyou the <strong>'full fat' Les Paul tone </strong>so many desire. But make sure \r\nyour shoulder is ready for the heft!</p>\r\n<h3>Slim Taper Neck Profile</h3>\r\n<p>The neck profile of a guitar is greatly important to how it feels when \r\nplaying. The Slim Taper shape on this model offers comfort for the player and \r\ngives access to the higher frets allowing you to reach all the way to the top of \r\nthe fretboard when you're rocking out! However, this is a Gibson after all, \r\nalthough named 'Slim Taper' there is still plenty to grab on to.</p>\r\n<h3>61R/T Burstbucker Pickups</h3>\r\n<p>Differing from the '50s Standard Les Paul, the burstbucker 61R and 61T \r\npickups selected for this model offer a little more heat and sizzle. With this \r\nguitar you'll be suited to playing Blues, Crunchy Rock, and great sustained \r\nleads. <strong>It sounds wonderful!</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Zero weight relief, giving the 'full fat' Les Paul tone</li>\r\n\t<li>The Slim Taper neck feels great and will have you playing all \r\n\tnight long!</li>\r\n\t<li>61R/T Burstbucker pickups offer blazing tones and sustain for days!</li>\r\n</ul>",

The thinner mahogany body and double cutaway design of this model \r\nencourages long, creative sessions of playing.</p>\r\n<p>As with the rest of this range, Gibson have gone for a more traditional look, \r\nsound, and spec for the SG. <strong>The SG's famous tone is all here</strong>; \r\nless overtly thick than a Les Paul, grouped with plenty of sustain.

      "The mahogany-top version of the Baby Taylor will yield a slightly darker, earthier tone than its spruce top sibling. The pint-size Dreadnought was originally inspired by a desire to provide a smaller, starter-size guitar for kids and a legitimate musical companion for travelers, but players have since adapted it for their needs in all sorts of creative ways, from high-stringing it to setting it up to play lap slide, to embracing alternate tunings that add unique acoustic flavors to recordings. This model also comes equipped with the Expression System Baby™ (ES-B) pickup, which incorporates piezo design elements from the Taylor ES2. The pickup is powered by an onboard preamp with a built-in digital chromatic tuner. The preamp/tuner unit features an LED display for tuning and low battery indication, along with Tone and Volume controls.",

Layered walnut back and sides are topped with a solid Sitka spruce soundboard, which together produce signature clear and balanced tone with a pleasing projection and midrange focus. The 1-11/16-inch nut width is slightly narrower than the standard 1-3/4-inch width of other steel-strings in the 300 Series and up, making it easier for developing players to navigate the fretboard. And with Taylor’s onboard Expression System 2 pickup, the guitar is ready to plug in whenever you are. The guitar ships in a durable lightweight gig bag.</p>",

The back and sides of this new guitar are constructed from a gorgeous, koa-pattern high-pressure laminate (HPL), generated from premium Hawaiian koa that was specially selected from Martin’s wood stores. A mother-of-pearl-pattern rosette and fingerboard inlay step up the flash of this model while a new wood neck, bridge, and fingerboard make the instrument lighter and more balanced and offer better sound transfer. It is also equipped with Fishman® MX electronics and strung with Martin’s Authentic Acoustic Lifespan® 2.0 strings, giving the D-X2E superior sound to match its great looks. ",

      "Built with a solid European spruce top, Indian rosewood back and sides, soft cutaway and Fishman Presys Blend preamp, the GK Studio Negra is the ultimate gigging instrument and a Córdoba best seller. Made for the stage, the GK Studio Negra is constructed with a slightly thinner body depth, neck, and nut width than a traditional Spanish guitar. The neck is designed to have little or no relief, offering low action for ease of comfort and quick playability. Flamenco players choose this model for a bassier and more robust tone in contrast to the bright, snappy sound of ‘blanca’ flamenco guitars. However, any guitarist looking for a new tone will feel right at home. Like every Córdoba guitar, this model has a two-way truss rod built into the neck. Other premium features include a high gloss finish, clear flamenco-style tap plate, and Savarez strings.\r\n\r\n",

An acoustic guitar with 7 strings may seem like an unusual choice, but its 12 string like chime gives it a beautiful sound that's been combined with a mahogany body and a Sitka spruce top to create something we feel is a bit special. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>7 Strings?</h3>\r\n<p>The additional string accompanies the G string, only an octave higher like on a 12 string guitar. The result is a tone that is a nod towards the classic tone of a 12 string guitar, without sounding like a cliché. It's definitely just as comfortable to play as a 6 string guitar, but has a signature confidence to its sound, with chords and melodies boldly announcing themselves from the guitar. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sigma Preamp</h3>\r\n<p>While the guitar sounds absolutely stunning when played acoustically, the addition of a pickup system makes the DM7E the ideal gigging companion. With a transparent sounding pickup, plus a built in EQ and tuner, getting your guitar sounding great in the live setting is easy!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>D-14 Body</h3>\r\n<p>Sigma's D-14 body is based one of the most famous acoustic guitar body shapes, the Dreadnought dates back over 100 years and is loved for its bold and rich tone, large size and its loud volume. It's also highly regarded for its versatility...fingerpicking, heavy strumming, rock music, folk, prog...the list of the Dreadnoughts uses are boundless.</p>\r\n<h2>Pros:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Unique 7 string design with beautiful chiming tones</li>\r\n<li>Built in pickup system makes this the ideal gigging guitar</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Other Things To Consider:</h2>\r\n<p>Love this?

It is not as loud and punchy as \r\nrosewood nor as straightforwardly mellow as mahogany, yet it bears its own \r\ndistinctive warmth. With frequency prominence starting a little below that of \r\nmahogany and dropping off a little earlier in the mid-range, the overall tone \r\ncould be described as dark and moody. Much like maple guitars, the reduced level \r\nof resonant overtones makes the Mango-bodied Blue Moon a perfect stage guitar: \r\nEminently controllable, balanced and resistant to feedback.</p>\r\n<p>Mango trees grow freely right across the Indonesian archipelago, so the \r\ntimbers used on Blue Moon guitars are sourced close to our workshops in Java, \r\nIndonesia, and as always, from certified timber merchants.</p>\r\n<p>Finished with flamed Maple binding, Macassan Ebony fittings, Fishman \r\nElectronics and complete in a hard case, your Faith Venus Blue Moon is sure to \r\nintrigue and delight you at every turn.</p>\r\n<p>The Venus is the now iconic shape that brought Faith Guitars to the \r\nconsciousness of so many players over the years. The combination of a 15\" lower \r\nbout and a slimmer depth of body looks to classic OM or Auditorium body-shapes \r\nfor inspiration, and makes the Venus the perfect compromise. In fact, the Naked \r\nVenus was voted 'The UK's Best Acoustic Guitar' at the MIA Music Awards in \r\n2013. </p>\r\n<p>It is still big enough to deliver a big acoustic performance, yet remains \r\nsmall enough for the player to jump around on stage with no problem. </p>\r\n",

A great guitar \r\nto play.</p>\r\n<p>After 50 years of making guitars, continual improvement through the use of \r\nemerging technologies, processes, and materials is still at the heart of our \r\nculture. Alvarez guitars are constructed correctly in every sense from raw \r\nmaterial preparation to construction and manufacturing processes. Their tone \r\nwoods are carefully cured; our components such as neck blocks and wood joints \r\nare carefully designed. The painting, sanding and polishing techniques we use \r\nare continually researched and developed, and our tone is impeccably crafted and \r\nmarried to a stable, designed and lively soundbox.</p>\r\n<p>The term “solid top” of course refers to the soundboard of an acoustic guitar \r\nbeing made of solid wood, rather than being laminated. However, just because the \r\ntop is solid, it does not necessarily mean the sound automatically benefits from \r\nthis feature. The tone of the instrument only improves significantly when the \r\nwhole guitar is built correctly to optimize the energy a solid soundboard can \r\ngenerate. Artist Series is built to do exactly this.</p>\r\n<p>Each model is designed to get the best out of its components, and for them to \r\nwork together to produce balance, lively projection and great response. These \r\ncomponents include a bracing architecture that is specifically designed for each \r\nbody shape or tonal requirement. Their Bi-level bridge is designed to heighten \r\nstring tension and improve sustain and response. Real bone nut and saddle, \r\npremium tonewoods and our crafted attenuated finish all further the quality of \r\nconstruction and positively impact the performance of the instrument.</p>\r\n<p>This caring approach to development comes from one simple goal: To deliver \r\nthe best guitars in the market at every price point, instruments that are truly \r\namazing value and offer a fantastic player experience.</p>\r\n",

      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The PRS SE A50E Blue Matteo combines decades worth of experience and craftsmanship to create a modern style acoustic guitar that's inviting to play and sounds amazing.  Whether you're playing acoustically or plugged in, the A50E always sounds great, thanks to the solid sitka spruce and \r\nfigured maple construction, PRS Hybrid “X” bracing and a Fishman GT1 pickup. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love PRS' interpretation of the classic acoustic guitar and think this would make an excellent investment for a student guitarist or a reliable gigging guitar for a professional musician. </p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Angelus Cutaway Body</h3>\r\n<p>The guitar is similar in size to a Grand Concert guitar, making it comfortable for most players and the Angelus cutaway allows for easy access to the higher frets. The medium-sized body brings a slight compression to the tone, making it ideal for both picking and fingerstyle playing. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PRS Hybrid “X” Bracing</h3>\r\n<p>PRS have evolved the traditional \"X\" design and incorporated a fan style bracing behind the bridge, this creates a round sweet tone that projects beautifully from the guitar. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fishman GT1</h3>\r\n<p>Fishman have a reputation as one of the best pickup manufacturers in the world and their acoustic guitar pickups are especially loved. The Fishman GT1 series pickup offers exceptional transparency to present the true sound of your guitar to a speaker system. The system also features a volume and tone control discreetly tucked into the soundhole, so there are no ugly control panels screwed onto the body. It looks like a traditional acoustic with the control and convenience of an electro-acoustic, truly the best of both worlds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfortable guitar for most players</li>\r\n<li>Fishman pickup makes gigging easy</li>\r\n<li>Blue Matteo finish on the back and sides is stunning!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This classic design \r\nhas also been a huge success for Epiphone and is brought to you here in the \r\nsmaller Coupe model. This makes it perfect for the travelling musician or those \r\nwho prefer smaller bodied guitars. The solid spruce top is accompanied by a \r\ncutaway for high fret access. The Active Pickup \r\nSystem offers up a whole range of possibilties. Grover mini-tuners hold your \r\nnotes tight and true.  </p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Presys II Preamp</h3>\r\n<p>Working in conjunction with the Sonicore pickup is the Presys II \r\npreamp. It features an on-board chromatic tuner, master volume, bass, treble \r\nplus a phase switch. So basically, all the controls you need in order to shape \r\nand fine tune your sound.</p>\r\n<h3>Grover Mini-Rotomatic Tuners</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring an 18:1 ratio, these Grovers are a great addition. They \r\nprovide excellent tuning stability and make string changes quick and easy. No \r\nmatter how hard you are strumming at least you know that these will be holding \r\nyour strings firmly and reliably.</p>\r\n<h3>Smaller Body</h3>\r\n<p>Love the Jumbo but looking for something less cumbersome? The smaller Coupe \r\nbody size makes both transport and comfort of playing a breeze. Whether you \r\nchoose this model due to preference or necessity, having the J-200 in a smaller \r\npackage will be a great addition to your playing regardless. </p>\r\n<h2>Highlight:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A classic looking model in a more compact size</li>\r\n\t<li>Extremely versatile due to the onboard pickup system</li>\r\n\t<li>Epiphone quality components and construction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The Acoustasonic Player Telecaster Arctic White Rosewood Fingerboard builds \r\non the huge success of Fender's innovative hybrid design and comes in at a more \r\naffordable price point. Crafted at Fender's Ensenada facility in Mexico, \r\nproduction has been kept to a high standard while opening up the Acoustasonic to \r\neven more guitarists by including it as part of their celebrated Player Series.</p>\r\n<p>While it does share many features with its famed American counterpart such as \r\nthe spruce and mahogany wood pairing, it also differs in some other ways. Power \r\ncomes from a 9V battery which means no waiting during recharge time, the number \r\nof voices is slightly reduced, and new colour options also set it apart with its \r\nown bold look. With the iconic Telecaster body shape, what's not to love about \r\nthis superb music maker!</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>Tuned Soundhole</h3>\r\n<p>Essential to the sound of the Acoustasonic, this is the same patented Tuned \r\nSoundhole design as used on the American models. Not only is it integral to the \r\nnatural acoustic voice of the guitar, it is also the basis of the amplified \r\nsound.

    productDetail:
      "<p>Faith HiGloss series have always been designed to offer both visual and aural beauty, and with the updating to HiGloss-3, we’re sure you’ll agree these wonderful instruments will continue to inspire musicians for generations to come.\r\n\r\n<p>Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure that these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain all the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series afficianados have come to expect. Using high grade Englemann Spruce for the top and highly-figured, 3-piece Rosewood bound in Flamed Maple for the back and sides, HiGloss-3 models also feature solid Flamed Maple binding on the front and use stripy Indonesian Ebony for the fingerboard, bridge, headplate and heelcap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and ‘zingy’, delivering great clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a smile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again at the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is achieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Faith Guitar is fitted with the refined, low-profile Fishman INK3 preamp system with the Sonicore piezo pickup located under the saddle. The preamp features a chromatic tuner, 3 band EQ and volume control. The output jack is located at the base of the guitar as part of the ingenious, easy-access battery compartment. All HiGloss series Faith Guitars are complete with a Faith Hardcase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Venus is the now iconic shape that brought Faith Guitars to the consciousness of so many players over the years. The combination of a 15\" lower bout and a slimmer depth of body looks to classic OM or Auditorium body-shapes for inspiration, and makes the Venus the perfect compromise. In fact, the Naked Venus was voted 'The UK's Best Acoustic Guitar' at the MIA Music Awards in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is still big enough to deliver a big acoustic performance, yet remains small enough for the player to jump around on stage with no problem.</p>",

      "<p>The Faith Neptune Baritone HiGloss is the very first Baritone model we have \r\nproduced. Featuring one of our favourite shapes – the baby-jumbo Neptune – the \r\nnew Baritone features a longer neck and scale length (700mm) and is fitted with \r\nlonger, higher gauge strings allowing it to be tuned to a lower register.</p>\r\n<p>Here’s for the slightly technical bit…</p>\r\n<p>A longer scale length means lower registers can be achieved without strings \r\nturning all floppy and sounding pretty horrible. The longer neck allows the use \r\nof heavier gauge strings which in turn means you can tune each string much lower \r\nthan usual, yet maintain the correct, playable string tension.</p>\r\n<p>So, you can still tune your Baritone in standard tuning and play the same \r\nchord shapes you’re used to, yet achieve a much lower sound. Common standard \r\nBaritone tunings include A D G C E A (a 5th lower) or a B E A D F&#9839; B (a \r\n4th lower).</p>\r\n<p>Where are Baritone guitars used?</p>\r\n<p>A staple of a wide range of musical styles from jazz, hard rock, surf, and \r\neven fingerstyle acoustic music. The darker, slightly more ominous tone works \r\nperfectly for certain types of music and is nigh-on impossible to achieve on a \r\nstandard acoustic guitar that typically operates in the higher tuning registers \r\nthat therefore deliver a brighter sound.</p>\r\n<p>A good Baritone should sound low enough in the mix to stand out from a \r\nstandard acoustic yet still sit high enough to cut through above the bass. Our \r\nHiGloss Baritone features an all-over high-gloss finish that is particularly \r\neffective in aiding the natural resonance of the Neptune body shape while \r\nensuring a fantastic level of clarity, string articulation and volume is \r\nachieved.</p>\r\n<p>Faith HiGloss series have always been designed to offer both visual and aural \r\nbeauty, and with the updating to HiGloss-3, we’re sure you’ll agree these \r\nwonderful instruments will continue to inspire musicians for generations to \r\ncome.</p>\r\n<p>Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure \r\nthat these incredibly popular models are available longer-term and yet retain \r\nall the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series aficionados have come to \r\nexpect. Using high grade Engelmann Spruce for the top and highly-figured, \r\n3-piece Rosewood bound in Flamed Maple for the back and sides, HiGloss-3 models \r\nalso feature solid Flamed Maple binding on the front and use stripy Indonesian \r\nEbony for the fingerboard, bridge, headplate and heelcap.</p>\r\n<p>Tonally, this combination of wood is generally bright and ‘zingy’, delivering \r\ngreat clarity. Visualising this as a frequency curve, it would be shaped like a \r\nsmile: high on the bass, dipping down through the middle and rising once again \r\nat the top end. Therefore greater string separation and articulation is \r\nachieved, lending itself to fingerstyle and solo pieces in particular.</p>\r\n",

Yamaha have ensured that the most important elements of playing - \r\n<strong>sound, feel and comfort - are the number one priority</strong>. Costs are kept \r\nat a reasonable level by using solid walnut for the back and sides, and by keeping the finish Matte.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Atmosfeel Pickup System\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>Atmosfeel is Yamaha's state of the art acoustic pickup system. By coming the sound from key positions in the guitar with an under-saddle piezo pickup for the low end, a contact pickup under the soundboard captures the high frequencies, while an internal microphone captures the mid frequencies as well as the resonance from the body. The result is a \r\n<strong>beautifully natural sounding guitar</strong> that doesn't sound shrill when amplified. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A modern take on a classic design\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Comfortable neck shape\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Sounds great acoustically and amplified</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>This Cole Clark FL1E-12 Bunya Maple Left Handed, is a true performers guitar. Cole Clark guitars are designed to be the best sounding acoustic guitars when plugged in. With their proprietary pickup system, you can certainly hear how much time and expertise has gone into the design and sound of these instruments. Plugged in the guitars sound incredibly natural as if listening to a mic'd up acoustic itself. Combined with sustainable Australian timbers and unique construction features, these guitars are one of a kind.   </p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>Sustainable Australian timber</h3>\r\n<p>Across the Cole Clark line you'll find all the wood used is not only sustainable but comes directly from Australia, cutting down on their climate impact. In addition to this, we're given access to tonewoods you don't usually find on acoustic guitars. The Queensland pale used on this guitar is unlike US maple, and has a neutral tone similar to South American mahogany but with more snap. Combined with the Bunya timber this guitar excels at percussive harder styles as the maple adds a fast attack. </p>\r\n<h3>Cole Clark Pickup System</h3>\r\n<p>The pickup system in these guitars is second to none. Developed to help you sound as natural as possible when plugged in and eliminate problem frequencies and tonalities that can so often plague electro-acoustic guitars. Starting with 6 piezo elements under the bridge which focus on the low-end frequencies, then a face sensor that covers your mid to high end starting at 350Hz. Finally, a condenser microphone covers the high end above 2.5kHz. Combined and fully customizable with the blend controls this <strong>creates an incredibly natural sound</strong>, that picks up everything even the sound of your hand against the neck. </p>\r\n<h3>Unique Construction</h3>\r\n<p>Once the pickup system was made Cole Clark designed the guitar around it. This has led to some unique construction methods, again in an effort to create the best performance acoustic guitars on the market. Notably, the guitar features a Spanish style heel construction. This means the neck is made, and then the body top is joined followed by the back and sides. Altogether meaning the neck is 1 piece all the way to the soundhole, <strong>creating an incredibly resonant instrument</strong>.  </p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sustainable Australian timber</li>\r\n<li>Very natural sounding pickup</li>\r\n<li>Unique construction method</li>\r\n<li>Top quality hardware</li>\r\n</ul>",

This guitar is built to be different, tuned low \r\n(B to B) with an extended scale length to suit and paired strings on the 3rd and \r\n4th tuned an octave up (like those on a 12 string guitar). The result is an \r\nacoustic that growls low, chimes high and projects like nothing else.</p>\r\n<p>The ABT60CE's unique sound is backed up with the superb LR Baggs StagePro EQ \r\nand Element pickup, ensuring the big sound translates across perfectly in any \r\nperformance, from the stage to the studio.</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>Baritone Build</h3>\r\n<p>The ABT60CE-8BK is a baritone guitar, meaning it's built to be tuned a \r\nperfect 4th down, B to B, instead of standard E to E, with an extended scale \r\nlength to accommodate the different string tension in such a tuning. The result \r\nis a <strong>uniquely lower pitched voice</strong> to the guitar, resonating at different \r\nfrequencies from a standard, without being low end heavy and boomy. All your \r\nchord fingerings and patterns work the same, but the sound is something else.</p>\r\n<h3>Octave Strings</h3>\r\n<p>The 3rd and 4th strings on this guitar feature a paired string each tuned an \r\noctave up, like the lower strings on a traditional 12 string guitar. This \r\nresults in a strong shimmer that really <strong>expands this lower-tuned instrument</strong> back \r\nup into the upper registers.</p>\r\n<h3>Quality Electronics</h3>\r\n<p>The ABT60CE-8BK comes rigged with the LR Baggs Element undersaddle pickup and \r\nStagePro EQ preamp, ensuring the voice and shimmer of this guitar<strong> \r\nperfectly \r\ntranslate across any performance</strong>, live or in the studio.</p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Baritone scale length and tuning</li>\r\n\t<li>Paired octave strings on the 3rd and 4th add unique shimmer</li>\r\n\t<li>Superb LR Baggs electronics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Crafted from Sitka \r\nspruce and maple, it produces a warm and balanced tone while the mahogany neck \r\nis a joy to play thanks to its Rounded profile. </p>\r\n<p>The 12" radius gives it a familiar feel, so whether you choose to use it to \r\nplay through hits from Elvis Is Back! or want a new acoustic for your own \r\nperformance, this well-crafted Elvis Dove from the skilled luthiers at Gibson \r\nwould make an excellent choice.</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Based on the Original</h3>\r\n<p>Back in 1969, Elvis was gifted a customized Gibson Dove by his father.

He gifted it to a member of the \r\ncrowd in 1975, yet again proving why he was The King. This guitar is based on \r\nthat original and successfully<strong> brings back some of that special magic</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Gorgeous Details</h3>\r\n<p>From the Mother of Pearl inlays on the rosewood fingerboard and bridge to the \r\n"ELVIS" truss rod cover, this guitar is <strong>full of beautiful appointments</strong> \r\nthat make you appreciate how much thought, time, and skill has gone into its \r\ncreation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>LR Baggs VTC</h3>\r\n<p>This premium pickup system is all about Volume, Tone, and Compression. With \r\nCompression often being the secret to great tone in the studio, LR Baggs has \r\ndeveloped an acoustic pickup system that utilises compression tuned to key \r\nfrequencies of the acoustic guitar to deliver <strong>a professional quality \r\nsound</strong> no \r\nmatter where you are. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>\r\n<p>Obviously fans of The King will love this Dove but with its classy yet \r\nunderstated look and excellent pickup system, it would greatly benefit any \r\nperforming acoustic guitarist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Crafted to perfection</li>\r\n\t<li>Sounds incredible, acoustically and thanks to the LR Baggs electronics</li>\r\n\t<li>A must-have for any Elvis fan</li>\r\n</ul>',

This is based on the design of master luthier  Kazuo Yairi, a design which is used in various forms across the Alvarez lines. This bridge increases string tension across the saddle and therefore increases response and sound projection of the guitar.

      "<p>In the late 1960s the situation for US guitar manufacturers became difficult: guitars that were made in Japan, looking very similar to US guitars, were flooding the market but at a much lower price. These guitars increasingly endangered the US manufacturers dominance on the market, and a few American companies reacted to that development in an appropriate manner: They did not take any legal steps but instead launched a counter offensive. That’s when “Sigma Guitars” was born. In 1970 “SIGMA”, the brand name for acoustic guitars, was launched. They were built by specially trained staff in the most efficient guitar factories in Japan and then sent to the US for inspection before being released for sale and shipping to the music stores.</p>",

      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The Breedlove Pursuit Exotic S Concert Sweetgrass CE Myrtlewood is a \r\nstunning, compact acoustic that's a dream for any style of guitarist. The \r\nConcert model is Breedlove's most popular, delivering a balance between compact \r\ncomfort and big body sound that lends itself superbly to any playing situation.</p>\r\n<p>This model features a solid top, and layered back and sides, of Myrtlewood. \r\nNative to the Oregon coast, Myrtlewood captures the deep bass of rosewood, the \r\nwarmth of mahogany and that glassy treble of maple, all in a single wood with a \r\ngorgeous grain.</p>\r\n<p>The other great features include the slim Breedlove \r\nprofile mahogany neck, pinless bridge and superb appointments like the handsome \r\nrosette and body binding and the sweetgrass finish.</p>\r\n<p>The Breedlove Pursuit Exotic S Concert CE also comes rigged with the superb Fishman \r\nPresys I pickup and preamp system. Fishman are rightly well known for their high \r\nquality guitar electronics, so you can be assured of a superb recreation of your \r\nguitar's natural tone.</p>\r\n<p>As a company, one of Breedlove's main focuses is on the ecological impact of \r\nthe materials they use to produce their superb instruments. To this end, they \r\ninsist on several policies as a company including never utilising wood from \r\nclear-cut stock, and only using fallen or sustainably felled trees.

This model features a handsome Myrtlewood top. \r\nThis charming wood is native to the Oregon coast in the USA, and captures the \r\ndeep bass of rosewood, the warmth of mahogany and that glassy treble of maple, \r\nall in a single wood with a gorgeous grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ecotonewood Back & Sides</h3>\r\n<p>Breedlove's Layered Ecotonewood back & sides aren't just the old basic \r\nplywood with a fancy veneer, instead, utilising three layers of sustainably \r\nsourced tonewood. In this case, a layer of mahogany is sandwiched between two \r\nlayers of Myrtlewood for a rich, complex tone and handsome grain pattern. This construction method has been developed by Breedlove to \r\ndeliver all the durability and low-cost-benefits of layered woods, while \r\navoiding the typically soft-center of ply that can dampen tonal response. The \r\nresult is a guitar that's still packed full of superb tone and character, \r\nwithout breaking the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Concert Body Shape</h3>\r\n<p>Breedlove's Concert is their most popular body shape, favoured by a host of \r\nplayers thanks to its well balanced and comfortable profile feels compact, but \r\ndoesn't sound it! It generates an articulate tone with plenty low end without \r\nbeing boomy, and lends itself to everything from precise fingerpicking to full \r\non big strums.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who Is It For?</h3>\r\n<p>The player looking for a stunning, sustainably built instrument with superb \r\ntone that won't break the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Made from all sustainably sourced materials</li>\r\n<li>Solid Myrtlewood top packs great tone and a stunning grain pattern</li>\r\n<li>Ecotonewood Layered Mahogany back & sides</li>\r\n\t<li>Fishman Presys I pickup and preamp</li>\r\n\t<li>Breedlove's powerful yet comfortable Concert body size</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The A1.7 by Solar Guitars has been developed to offer optimised performance for the gigging metal guitarist. By using the most advanced components like locking tuners, an Evertune bridge and custom Seymour Duncan pickups, Solar have created a fantastic looking and ergonomic guitar that's built to sound great and keep sounding great, no matter how hard you play. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This 7 string model is finished in a striking Lime Burst Matte finish that allows you to see the \r\ngorgeous grain of the flamed maple veneer under the paint and is accented by black hardware. It's a tasteful take on the extreme guitar and would suit those looking to play aggressive music at high speeds!</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Type A Series</h3>\r\n<p>Solar Guitar founder and YouTube celebrity Ola Englund designed the Type A Series of guitars with gigging artists in mind. Combining decades of touring experience, he set out with the vision to create the most reliable and fluid feeling instrument possible for use on the road. With impenetrable tuning stability thanks to the locking tuners and Evertune bridge, an ergonomic one volume. \r\none tone and 5-way pickup selector configuration, Luminlay side dots, 24 super jumbo frets and the awesome sounding high output Duncan Solar pickups, if the quest was to create the ultimate gigging machine for metal, we'd say that the mission's been accomplished!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evertune Bridge</h3>\r\n<p>The Evertune bridge has been a true breakthrough in the guitar world over the last few years, especially loved by metal players where aggressive precise playing is met with running and jumping around on stage. Many factors can interfere with your guitar's tuning, from humidity and temperature, to playing style and even how new your strings are. Evertune bridges use a patented mechanical system which remembers the string tension after you tune your guitar, once it's set and the system is activated the guitar will never go out of tune. Changes in climate, strings stretching or general aggressive playing are all corrected by the bridge, leaving the guitar in tune in any situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Duncan Solar</h3>\r\n<p>Englund collaborated with Seymour Duncan to develop a pickup specifically for Solar Guitars. The Duncan Solar pickups are exclusive to Solar Guitars and compliment the guitar's alder body perfectly to create a tone with a tight low end and clear highs. Of course, they sound amazing overdriven, but Ola knew it was important for them to clean up nicely and the result is a pickup set that's versatile over a wide range of dynamics. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The ultimate metal guitar!</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Evertune bridge and locking tuners offer impervious tuning stability</li>\r\n<li>7 string model makes extreme low tunings possible without compromise</li>\r\n\t<li>Stunning Lime Burst finish atop the Flamed Maple Veneer</li>\r\n</ul>",

    description:
      "<h2>At A Glance: </h2>\r\n<p>The PRS SE Custom 22 Semi Hollow Santana Yellow delivers quality and affordability in a concise package. With it's semi hollow body and the positioning of the neck humbucker on this 22 fret model you have access to plenty of sweet warm tones. Though with the 85/15 S pickups you can still get plenty of biting bright tones. All round this is a great choice for musicians of any level, not only does this PRS provides some gorgeous tones, the Santana Yellow looks stunning over the Flame Maple. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Features We Love:</h2>\r\n<h3>85/15 S Pickups\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>The first two numbers of the pickups name indicate the year that the original pickup came out. The last two digits denote what year that pickup design was reissued with modern enhancements. The pickups mounted in this guitar are \r\n<strong>based on the pickups loaded in the first PRS guitars</strong>. The earlier pickups' tolerance variations have been shrunk to unnoticeable differences in sonic output by utilising new computer programmable machinery. PRS aim to keep improving their innovations as new technology develops.   \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Wide Thin Neck\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>The neck is where most of the playability of the guitar is decided. PRS have thought meticulously about the shape and feel of the necks they offer. This guitar sports a Wide Thin neck. This neck gives you a thin profile with a wide fretboard, \r\n<strong>a combination championed by fast players</strong>. The maple neck is given a gloss finish and is capped with a rosewood fretboard.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Coil Split\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>The push/pull coil split is located within the tone control.

If your holy grail is \r\nfaithful Alnico single-coil tone with modern refinements and superb \r\ncraftsmanship, the Legacy makes for an excellent choice.</p>\r\n<p>The Legacy’s vintage-spec CLF-100 Alnico V pickups have that unmistakable \r\nchime and quack reminiscent of the best examples from the late ‘50s, thanks to \r\nthe work of G&L’s Paul Gagon. Gagon found his inspiration reviewing original \r\nprints stored in Leo’s private laboratory at G&L, but that was just the start. \r\nIn the early ’80s, Gagon was an R&D engineer at another company when he was \r\ntasked with finding out what was so special about the early bolt-on guitars many \r\nplayers raved about. Gagon analyzed many examples of what were considered holy \r\ngrail guitars, spending time out on the shop floor talking to builders still \r\nworking in the pickup department since the ‘50s, all on a quest to discover \r\nwhere the real mojo was – and wasn’t. What he learned from the builders matched \r\nhis own engineering analysis. You see, back in the day, the actual spec of \r\npickups coming down that old production line varied considerably. That meant \r\ncoming up with the right specs for the Legacy pickups was more challenging than \r\nsimply following the prints. Gagon’s persistence paid off as the Legacy garnered \r\nrave reviews from both players and magazines like Guitar Player and Guitar \r\nWorld.</p>\r\n<p>This axe is no slave to the past, however, starting with Leo’s PTB™ (Passive \r\nTreble and Bass) system which functions on all three pickups for dramatically \r\nmore variety than the vintage setup. What’s more, the Legacy features a Leo \r\nFender-designed Dual-Fulcrum vibrato, a work of engineering art which allows \r\nbending up or down with unsurpassed stability, while offering a silky feel \r\nthrough its beefy aluminum vibrato arm.</p>\r\n<p>The Legacy is all about honest, classic Alnico tone complemented by Leo’s own \r\nmodern refinements. And now, it’s available at a price within reach of every \r\nworking musician. Once you play a G&L Tribute Series, you’ll never look back.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Now with the Player Plus series you have access to all those signature single coil tones without any interfering hum or buzzing! Add to this the Push/Pull on the second \r\ntone pot which adds the neck pickup to Position 1 & 2, you have an incredibly versatile instrument. </p>\r\n<h3>Modern Neck Design</h3>\r\n<p>Like every guitar in the Player Plus series the Nashville Telecaster has a wonderfully comfortable modern neck. A slightly wider 1.685\" nut starts of the satin \r\nfinished neck,  while the modern C shape and rolled edges keep it comfortable on your hand. The 12\" radius gives a modern feel to your chords and licks without feeling too flat.</p>\r\n<h3>Locking Tuners</h3>\r\n<p>In this day and age we don't always want to fiddle with the perfect winding around your string post, which is why \r\nlocking tuners can be such a welcome choice.

    productDetail:
      "<p>Designed as the perfect nylon stringed guitar for non-classical specialists, \r\nthe Faith Lyra has a specially profiled neck that is slimmer than a traditional \r\nclassical guitar. However, unlike other 'hybrid' guitars, it is not so narrow \r\nthat proper fingerstyle technique is inhibited. So, you're well served whether \r\nplaying Rodrigo or Radiohead.</p>\r\n<p>Although standing proud in its own right as the first nylon stringed guitar \r\nwe have produced, the Faith Lyra does share many characteristics with our hugely \r\npopular HiGloss series guitars. Its solid Red Cedar top and solid 3-Piece \r\nRosewood back and sides are finished with the same all-over high gloss finish \r\nused on all HiGloss 3 guitars. This helps to bring the beautifully warm and rich \r\ntraditional tonal character of a cedar and rosewood nylon stringed instrument to \r\nlife, whilst also delivering an incredible level of natural resonance and \r\nvolume. It’s all there at your fingertips.</p>\r\n<p>Using a more sustainable 3-piece, solid rosewood back design, we can ensure \r\nthat these incredibly popular HiGloss 3 models are available longer-term and yet \r\nretain all the tonal and visual punch that HiGloss-series afficianados have come \r\nto expect.</p>\r\n<p>The Lyra features a Mahogany neck with a figured Ebony fingerboard and a \r\nfigured Ebony bridge alongside a 5cm Indonesian Rosewood soundhole border.</p>\r\n\t",

This size lends it to a large variety of playing styles and makes it appealing to a great number of players.</p>\r\n<h3>Expression System 2</h3>\r\n<p>This is widely recognised as one of the greatest acoustic pickup systems \r\navailable. It translates every ounce of tone, detail and dynamic from your \r\nfingertips, strings and guitar wood. This gives the audience an accurate and \r\nfully realistic translation of your performance.</p><h2>Highlights:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Full, powerful sound despite its slightly cut-down size</li>\r\n<li>Warm, strong tone with a slight natural compression</li>\r\n<li>High quality yet affordable</li>\r\n<li>Comfortable and compact size</li>\r\n<li>Works great as a travel guitar</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n",
